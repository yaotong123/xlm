					<p>The "International Cooperation Summit Forum" will be held in Beijing from May 14 to 15. National Development and Reform Commission Western Development Division inspector Ou Xiao Li 8 guest network on the "build" area along the way 'philosophy, practice and China's contribution' topic and friends to communicate.</p>
					<p>
						Ou Xiaoli said that the "one side of the way" initiative in 2013 to write the party's 18th Plenary Session of the resolution, officially became China's major national development strategy. There is no doubt that "there is a way" is a long-term strategy, relative to the long-term strategy, the past three years is actually a short moment, but because of China's efforts, coupled with the international community's response, its effectiveness far Over expectation.</p>
					<p>Ou Xiaoli pointed out that the reason why China can achieve the desired effect is that the principle of "three parties" put forward by China in promoting the construction of "one side of the road" is to discuss, build and share.</p>
					<p>
						Ou Xiaoli that "co-operation" to solve the "how to build" the problem. China has put forward the "area along the way" has repeatedly stressed that with the country along the development plan, development strategy, long-term consideration of docking. The so-called strategic docking, that is, we have to take into account the concerns of neighboring countries, interests, and this strategic docking does not attach any political conditions. Some countries talk to people about cooperation, they may take their own that "political correct" some of the criteria, such as democracy, human rights and so on to talk about cooperation. China is talking about seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual benefit and win-win, respect for the development model of various countries and the choice of national governance model. "Build" to solve the "who will build" the problem. We stress that all countries should strengthen their policy of communication, and carry out all-round cooperation, interests, responsibilities and destiny together in a broader field, wider scope and higher level. They will be together and prosper together.</p>
					<p>
						Of course, we are also in the process of promoting the importance of third-party cooperation, the so-called third-party cooperation, that is, we hope that countries outside the country, joined in, looking for common development opportunities, each country to play their own different advantages, cooperation and benefit sharing. The most commendable point in the process of building, reflecting the superiority of the Chinese system. China in the process of advancing to follow the government to promote, market-led, business model, enterprises in the front, followed by the project, followed by financial services, political leaders directly to promote. This kind of efficient collaborative promotion model, not all countries can follow suit.</p>
					<p>"Sharing" to solve the "who built" problem. "With the way all the way," the construction, we have no concealment, of course, of course, the interests of China, "along the way" construction is not poverty alleviation, not foreign aid. But the interests of China is tied with the interests of partners, can be described as a glory, a loss and loss.</p>
					<h3>The following is an interview Record:</h3>
					<h3>Liu Xi: "along the way" initiative has been put forward for three years, the relevant work of the country is also gradually progress from the point to the surface, what aspects of China's current work, and then achieved what kind of results?</h3>
					<p>
						In September and October 2013, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) put forward the major initiative of "Building the Silk Road Economic Zone" and "The Maritime Silk Road in the 21st Century", and received the strong attention from the international community and the positive response of many countries. But also gives a lot of new connotation, it is not only to maintain the open world economic system, promote the global economic recovery of the Chinese program, but also deepen regional cooperation, strengthen the civilizations of each other, Learn from each other's wisdom. Of course, also reflects China as the world's largest developing countries and the second largest economy to promote the global governance system towards a more fair, just and reasonable direction of China to play.</p>
					<p>China is both the "one side of the way," the first advocate, but at the same time is responsible, there are practical practitioners, in the three years time, the Chinese side has done a lot of work, paid a lot of effort.</p>
					<p>First of all, the Chinese side has formulated and formulated the strategic plan to promote the construction of "all the way along the way", and published the vision and action to build the "one way along the way", and made a top-level design for the "one way" construction.</p>
					<p>
						In the second aspect, China has formed a multi-level and wide-ranging strategic dialogue with many countries in accordance with the concept of co-operation, co-construction and sharing, and formed a broad consensus. So far, we have signed cooperation agreements with more than 40 countries to build "all the way along the way" and have signed agreements with some international organizations.</p>
					<p>
						The third aspect, the two main aspects of infrastructure interconnection and international capacity cooperation, we called "dual core" and two wheel drive, China has promoted a number of major cooperation projects to start construction, such as from the infrastructure Interconnection point of view, we all know that the old railway, Yavan high-speed rail, the oil and gas pipelines in Central and Central Asia, Gwadar port, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor on the Karakoram Highway reconstruction project and so on.</p>
					<p>From the point of view of international production cooperation, China has cooperated with more than 30 countries in the development of international production capacity. Together with some countries, China has set up a number of bilateral and multilateral production cooperation funds, such as machinery, building materials, steel and so on. Some industry cooperation to promote the very good.</p>
					<p>
						We are now along the establishment of 56 overseas industrial park, as one of the white industrial park, in the Thai-yong industrial park, have become a Chinese enterprises Baotuan go out of a bright business card. Cooperation in the financial sector is also very smooth forward. In addition, the humanities and cultural exchanges in all aspects are booming, it should be said that the basis of public opinion is also increasingly strong.</p>
					<p>Therefore, these three years, it should be said, "one way along the" construction is indeed from scratch, from point to surface in the forward, showing a very good momentum.</p>
					<h3>Liu Xi: You have just said that the "one way along the way" initiative actually borrowed the ancient Silk Road, the memory symbol, you have just sort out the three years to achieve some of the results, these results are more than we expected the right ?</h3>
					<p>Ou Xiao Li: Yes.</p>
					<h3>Liu Xi: What do you think is more than expected?</h3>
					<p>
						Ou Xiaoli: This initiative is proposed in 2013, 2014, the party's 18th session of the Third Plenary Session of the resolution, "along the way" to formally become China's major national development strategy. There is no doubt that "one way" is a long-term strategy, relative to the long-term strategy, the past three years is actually a short moment, but because of China's efforts, coupled with the international community's response, just I have made so many achievements, really like the general secretary in August 17 last year, "one side of the road" work talk about, the results far more than expected.</p>
					<p>
						Why did you get such a good result? I think this problem is worthy of our study, we all know, "one way" strategy is the main focus of the Eurasian continent, Eurasia is the world's largest continent, strategic position is very important. China put forward the "one way along the way" is to focus on the Eurasian stage, but we have a deeper consideration, we are also concerned about the world such a big chess game. Because the continent is very important, so the global forces in this continent have action, are very concerned about. Of course, Russia is also very concerned about, but he is not very good economic situation, so the impact is slightly worse. Japan is also concerned, but Japan's political influence is almost that. Now look at the real above which there is a relatively large strategic investment in Europe, the United States, China, these three aspects, what is a very interesting phenomenon? 2009, 2013, 2013, I talk about these three forces, Europe, the United States, China, respectively, put forward their own Eurasian strategy, and their respective Eurasian strategy is a very interesting phenomenon, all with Silk Road logo, Europe called the new Silk Road plan, the United States called the Silk Road strategy, China is the Silk Road economic zone and the 21st century Maritime Silk Road, referred to as "all the way", all with silk The way of the mark.</p>
					<p>
						The EU was put forward in 2009, because he opened a southern corridor in 2009 - the new Silk Road summit, at this summit put forward such a plan, the main purpose of what? He wants to strengthen cooperation with some countries involved in the southern corridors to strengthen energy cooperation, while the expansion of this influence to Central Asia, South Asia, some countries cooperation. His main purpose is to get rid of the EU's dependence on Russia's energy resources, mainly through this plan to solve this problem.</p>
					<p>
						The new Silk Road strategy in the United States is proposed by Ms. Hillary in the United States in India in 2011. What is her main consideration is that what is the purpose of connecting Afghanistan and South Asia with Afghanistan as the center? That is, after the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in the future, to maintain the United States in that area of influence and control.</p>
					<p>In 2013, the president suggested that "one way along the way". We are now thinking about how many people are still talking about, still discuss the new Silk Road program, the new Silk Road strategy of the United States, we are talking about the President proposed the "one way."</p>
					<h3>Liu Xi: What is the reason for this?</h3>
					<p>
						Ou Xiao Li: Because I have been working on the past few years in the "all the way", so I have recently done some thinking on this issue. I think this is the reason or mystery is actually very simple, that is, China in promoting the "one way" in the construction of the proposed principles of construction, that is, "three common" principle, is to discuss, build and share.</p>
					<p>
						"To discuss" to solve the "how to build" the problem. China has been "along the way" has repeatedly stressed that with the country along the development plan, development strategy, long-term consideration of the docking, sometimes called the strategic docking, that is, we have to take into account the concerns of others, the interests of others. And our strategy of docking China does not attach any political conditions, with some of our friends, some countries their practice is not the same, they talk with others when they may take their own that "political correct" some of the criteria, For example, democracy, human rights and so on such standards to talk with people talk about, you want to meet me these conditions, which makes the partners feel very uncomfortable, do not think you are to help me, but that you are to engage in things of. In fact, like the rhetoric of democracy and human rights, the Chinese people have their own views, their own understanding. But we never forced our partners to accept our ideology, values, we pay attention to do friends before doing business, we talk about seeking common ground, mutual benefit and win-win, respect for each country's own development model and the choice of national governance model, so we When we talk with people, we will not be on the domestic affairs of others, make irresponsible remarks, of course, we will not like some countries also secretly engage in some color revolution, so people are willing to talk to us Think this is a very important reason.</p>
					<p>
						"Build" to solve the "who will build" the problem. We stress that countries should strengthen policy communication and engage in broader cooperation in a broader, broader and higher level. We stressed that the project together to do, the interests, responsibilities, fate tied together, tied together, a glory, a loss and loss. Of course, we also in the process of promoting the importance of third-party cooperation, the so-called third-party cooperation, that is, we hope that the countries outside the country, also joined in, to find a common development opportunities here, each country to play their own different advantages, everyone Work together to make a fortune. The most commendable point in the process of co-construction, the superiority of the Chinese system, the superiority of our model is reflected, we follow the process of promoting the government to promote the market-led, business operation to promote the model, business In front of all the projects are business ahead, some of our financial services institutions are followed by political leaders who are directly driven. So this kind of collaborative push mode, not all countries can learn from, so such a model is extremely efficient, with the countries in the talk when people feel this way is very good.</p>
					<p>
						"Sharing" to solve the "who built" problem. "There is no way to the construction of the road, we have no hidden, of course, the interests of China in the inside, so I have been talking about" all the way "construction is not poverty alleviation, not foreign aid, of course, the interests of China in there. But our interests are tied with the interests of our partners, that is, I just talk about a glory, a loss and loss.</p>
					<p>Liu Xi: that is, we and the partners are sharing the relationship between interests.</p>
					<p>
						Ou Xiao Li: Yes, we are put together, is tied together. We think about it, we talk about "all the way" hope along the various countries to strengthen the extensive cooperation between, there are many areas of cooperation. The most important I think is two areas, one is the infrastructure interoperability, one is the international production capacity cooperation, we say that the two wheels, through the cooperation of these two wheels to promote other areas of cooperation to promote all areas forward.</p>
					<p>
						These two areas just very much in line with the "one way along the way" countries of the aspirations of the Eurasian continent so many countries, the situation varies widely, cultural and religious are not the same, but they also have a common ground, they are in common? Are basically underdeveloped, so the development of the economy, improve people's livelihood is their strong appeal, want to be able to achieve their own industrialization, to achieve their own industrialization, this time there is a country, he is willing and he also has this ability to help you achieve their own Of industrialization, industrialization, it will certainly be well received by others. I have just said that the other two forces are also a big investment here, the EU to engage in the new Silk Road plan is mainly staring at people's energy, he also want to get rid of the EU's dependence on energy in Russia, the United States is purely because Geo-political considerations, in fact, away from their land, he also want to have influence here, control, and even think of this way to contain the country, to contain that country. So this is a comparison, we are willing to cooperate, I think this is why "all the way" put forward after many echoes, we are willing to cooperate with you a very important reason. Immediately this month on the 14th, 15th to convene this summit, there are so many national leaders to come also a good description of this point.</p>
					<h3>
                Liu Xi: just the Secretary of Europe with us in detail about why we have made such a good result, I think the first is that we have an open mind, inclusive mind, and then find a good point of interest, balance Point to balance the interests of each country. The question below is that in the context of the current uncertain international situation and the increase in globalization, what will the "one side of the way" initiative bring to the development of the country and the improvement of the global economy?</h3>
					<p>
						Ou Xiao Li: This is a very interesting question. Because the general secretary of the "one way along the" time, the emergence of some of these years we call the "black swan" events have not yet appeared, the so-called anti-globalization trend has not yet so outstanding performance, that time to learn the total The secretary put forward the "one way along the way." I have fully proved that the Secretary-General's vision, his international political and economic trends to predict, predictive and forward-looking. I have written a very short article, I put the "one way all the way" to do a induction, I said "one way all the way" is to promote global economic recovery in China, is to promote mutual understanding of civilization, mutual wisdom of the Chinese wisdom is to promote The global governance system changes in China. Economic globalization is the inevitable product of the development of social productive forces and scientific and technological progress. It has provided a strong impetus to the growth of the world economy because he has promoted the flow of production factors, the progress of science and technology and the exchanges between people. Is to promote the progress of the global community, but we should also see that globalization is the "double-edged sword", it is to promote global economic growth, but also in the process is indeed caused some uneven, Of the process, although we all benefit, but some countries may benefit more, some countries may benefit less, less benefit may feel that globalization is not good, and in a country may be within the elite layer, Big companies benefit more, grassroots, the general public or small businesses benefit less, because it can also be very clear that we say that the process of globalization, the various factors of production can flow around the world, but you think of the flow of elite It may be easier, which country has a high wage income, has developed for himself, he may be able to go, but the general public is not enough education It may move up is not so easy. In this way, some describe a few happy several months to worry about, in this case some people feel unbalanced.</p>
					<p>
						Since 2008, because the global economy has suffered a financial crisis, these years the situation is not very good recovery, countries are indeed looking for to promote economic revitalization, recovery approach, this time some people put the "guilt" plus In the globalization of the body. Just like this year's chairmanship at the Davos Forum has done a metaphor, I feel very good, he said that some people think that economic globalization is Alibaba's cave, which are treasures, and now it was compared to Pandora's box. So he put the blame on the globalization of the body after the prescription is to find some anti-globalization approach. So we also see the past two years, some countries in the past holding high the banner of liberalization, his populism, protectionism, that is, anti-globalization, the proliferation of ideas. I think this is indeed the world economy with a disease, but what is the regret? They are taking medicine, but eating the wrong medicine, there is no right medicine.</p>
					<p>
						China is the beneficiaries of reform and opening up, but also an important contributor to globalization, with the help of the power of globalization, in the reform and opening up three or four decades time, China has made the world's attention development achievements. Should be able to say, change the pattern of the world economy. In this case, China, as a responsible developing country, has the obligation and the ability to make our contribution to the development of the world economy and come up with the Chinese program. So what is this program? I think it is "along the way", because "all the way" is what? That is, all countries, regardless of size, strength, rich and poor, equal treatment to participate in cooperation, is the country according to their own advantages to strengthen cooperation, to achieve win-win cooperation, but also countries to discuss, build, To discuss how the world should manage the cooperation. So this for the development of the world economy to build a more open and more inclusive platform for each country to achieve their own economic development to promote the recovery of the global economy provides a good platform.</p>
					<h3>Liu Xi: In addition to our economy for the country and the global economic recovery have a role in promoting, bring good, there are no other aspects will bring some good change?</h3>
					<p>
						Ou Xiao Li: According to the past few years we work on the contact, with all aspects of contact. Now we are more and more consistent on some issues, or more and more consensus, with these consensus we think the future development of the situation will be better. What consensus? For example, we feel more and more, the world is more and more you have me, I have you, we formed such a community, everyone's fate, the interests are actually closely linked to the problems and difficulties are common To solve these problems and difficulties, alone can not solve the power of their own, can not cope, so we all have a strong hope to be able to coordinate their policies, coordinate their own strategies, together through a cooperative way to achieve The desire to develop. It is obvious that we feel it.</p>
					<p>
						In addition, through our work is also exposed to a lot of countries from China's 40 years of development experience also see to promote economic recovery, to solve people's livelihood and so on, learn from China's experience, what experience in China? For example, we now emphasize a thing called the interconnection of infrastructure, we all think that may be a good cut entrance. So, now that each country's investment in infrastructure, mutual understanding of interoperability, we feel that a high degree of consistency. In fact, whether it is developed economies, or developing countries, or less developed countries, have a high degree of understanding.</p>
					<p>Liu Xi: is this consensus is not developed the difference between the underdeveloped.</p>
					<p>
						Ou Xiaoli: Yes, because the developed countries in the past the infrastructure situation is better, but all to a replacement era, this time seems to have some WeChat, the Americans write the letter or what, look at Beijing, Shanghai subway station, and then Look at our American things. In fact, they are more complete in the past, but now to the need to upgrade.</p>
					<p>
						Emerging market countries, he already has a certain basis, but to quickly improve the stage of improvement. While the less developed countries have just begun to engage in their own infrastructure. So, through our "one way all the way" concept, we put forward such a way, the path, for many countries we strengthen cooperation, we feel at least provide a choice it.</p>
					<p>
						Liu Xi: some reference to the role. And I also share a little story with the European Secretary, I think the infrastructure interconnection will eventually form a certain basis on the basis of public opinion, such as when you go abroad to play can feel, especially to some African countries, See you will know you are Chinese, you will use your Chinese "Hello, what is your name, what are you doing, you eat it?" Hello with your warm greeting, I think this is the past is not completely out To the. Is a very big difference.</p>
					<p>Ou Xiao Li: That sure, because we regardless of economic and trade cooperation or cultural exchanges, first of all we can easily come and go, this is a foundation.</p>
					<h3>Liu Xi: What do we say about the "one-way" initiative and the existing international cooperation platform?</h3>
					<p>
						Ou Xiao Li: Now there are a lot of platform, the mechanism of things. "With the way" with a variety of existing platforms, it has some of its own characteristics, the most important feature is "all the way" reflects the initiative of China, which is driven by China, which is the most important. And now the world most of the platform mechanism is a border, our "area along the way" is open, we do not have any 65 countries or 78 countries or more than 100 countries of the strict distinction, of course, our main battlefield Is the Eurasian continent, but did not say that these countries.</p>
					<p>Liu Xi: Our strategy is facing the earth.</p>
					<p>Ou Xiao Li: We are open, it is very obvious that this is not the same as some of the existing international cooperation platform. Of course, we have a larger platform, with the original platform in many ways can be complementary, does not form a conflict, it is in many ways to strengthen communication and cooperation. I think there is a problem we have to know clearly, because through years of work, I have an experience, that is, when talking about international cooperation, between the two countries to talk, and add a country, and even add more countries To talk about, the difficulty is completely different. Because each country's demands are not the same, the situation is not the same, so I always talk about talking about foreign cooperation when we want to jump collective dance, but more to dance ballroom dance. I think that multilateral is very important, but we may have to do bilateral, we talk about a family, and finally through bilateral cooperation to promote multilateral cooperation. So on this issue, we are going through a variety of bilateral cooperation, if we realize that we may need a more and more perfect, such as the establishment of institutional considerations, that we all recognize this time It is time to get to the ground.
					</p>
					<p>Liu Xi: So talk about cooperation when the work is also a skill, the first break.</p>
					<p>Ou Xiaoli: We do not call each break, we first talk about a family, because the situation is different in each country, the appeal is not the same, the requirements are not the same.</p>
					<h3>Liu Xi: We know that in May this year to convene the "area along the way" international cooperation summit forum, will be held in Beijing, how can we use this opportunity and the participating countries to establish a closer relationship? As well as the next step "along the way" initiative should focus on which exchanges continue to advance?</h3>
					<p>
						Ou Xiaoli: 14,15 this month to convene the "area along the way" international cooperation summit forum, is "one way" this initiative put forward after the convening of the largest and highest level of an event, and now we all know that there are 28 countries The heads of state and government heads to attend, there are hundreds of ministers of various countries, in addition to some large entrepreneurs, large think tank scholars, to participate in such a meeting. This is a good chance, really is a good chance. I think it is not able to achieve some new results in three areas, one is to be able to reach some consensus.</p>
					<h3>Liu Xi: what aspects of consensus?</h3>
					<p>
						Ou Xiaoli: I just talked about, we build "along the way" which put forward to discuss, build, share the principle of "one way along the" core values, peace cooperation, open tolerance, mutual education, cooperation Win-win, including our goal is to establish a human fate community, and so on such things, is more and more accepted, and some have actually formed a consensus. But "the way all the way" to reflect the final to some specific economic programs, projects, which requires us at many more specific level but also to reach a consensus. I also know that at this meeting, we have a lot of departments, such as energy, transportation, there must be some cooperation agreement signed. These are in the promotion of "one by one" construction of the implementation of more specific arrangements, these work for the next step "one way all the way," the real floor will play a very good role. Of course I expect to be able to achieve more and better results in this area. The second is to hope to get more wisdom, because the summit in addition to the opening ceremony, in addition to the heads of the round table, there is a high-level meeting, high-level meeting divided six parallel theme, one of them is a think tank Of the summit. "There is a lot of problems, to solve these problems, I think we need the wisdom of the world, we say that this thing is not China's solo, but also a lot of problems, Is everyone's chorus, then you need the wisdom of the world. This time there are so many think tanks of experts and scholars to come together to take some thoughts of the collision, for the "one way along the way" to contribute their own wisdom, should be good for the next step. The third I hope to be able to attract more countries through this will join us, we "along the way" construction is open, no boundaries, there is no 60 countries said. We say that "there is a way" to get more and more countries to respond, but there are indeed some countries have concerns, have his ideas, I hope we can see the "one way along the" results, to attract more friends to join To our "friends circle" inside to come. This cause is a great cause, it is difficult to do it, but if it is for everyone to do, then this thing is not difficult.</p>
					<h3>Liu Xi: the next step "area along the way" initiative should focus on what aspects to continue to promote it?</h3>
					<p>
						On August 17 last year, the General Secretary organized a symposium organized by the General Secretary, and the General Secretary also said that it was actually a work promotion meeting. At this meeting, he put forward the "eight practical", one is to be practical Promote the unity of thinking, the second to effectively promote the implementation of the plan, the third to effectively promote the coordination and coordination, the fourth to effectively promote key projects landing, the fifth is to effectively promote financial innovation, the sixth is to promote popular contacts, the seventh to promote public opinion, Eight is to effectively promote security. I think the next step "along the way" work, is around the implementation of the General Secretary of the "eight practical" instructions to do our job. I have just said, "along the way" blueprint has been painted, the top design has been completed. Recently I also noted that some school scholars, said after the end of this will be "all the way" to enter the 2.0 version of the era, then I told them no version 2.0, we "all the way" on this a blueprint, blueprint has been painted , We are a blueprint dry in the end, line up sleeves dry, to nail the spirit of this thing to do a good job.</p>
