Of course, we all love to buy Chinese goods, Vietnam spent on the import of banknotes, 34.7% paid to China, Indonesia and Thailand also exceeded 20%. </p>
					<p>Silk Road, which Chinese goods sold the best? Selling the most money to the number of "motor, electrical equipment", came in second is the "boiler, machinery", steel and plastic products ranked third. China's money to buy the most is "fossil fuels."</p>
					<p>Read good "all the way" business, all countries can find the exchange of the way of making money.</p>
					<p>And then from the land, sea and air three-dimensional all-round, take a look at "all the way" facilities Unicom vivid scene.</p>

					<p>If the flow of trade is the key, facilities Unicom is a priority to promote the field, then the policy is an important guarantee of communication.</p>
					<p>In the "one way along the" along the line, if each aircraft on behalf of Xi Jinping chairman of a visit, nearly four years, there are more than 20 aircraft sorting in the shuttle; the same is the past few years, more than 50 heads China visit.
