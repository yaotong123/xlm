				<p>From the initial one-way operation to the present two-way operation, carried in the Central European class on the growing variety of goods. From the small commodities and electronic products to textiles, cars and accessories, machinery and equipment, furniture, etc., a trip full of Chinese goods shipped to the class arrived in Europe; Spanish wine, Polish milk, Bulgarian rose oil, the German car ... more and more Of the European goods also catch the European and international flights to the Chinese market.</p>
				<p>Central and European countries not only sent to the countries along the "Made in China", but also brought the "Chinese opportunity."
