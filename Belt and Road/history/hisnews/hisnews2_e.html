					<h1>Ancient Silk Road reveals the Han and Tang Dynasties open and inclusive attitude</h1>
					<p> 2100 years ago, the Chinese Han Dynasty Zhang Qian out of the Western Regions, since then the land of China and the Western states between the "diligent run station, not always in time; Shanghu vendors, the Japanese under the plug." Similarly, on the Silk Road on the Sea, Zheng He went down to the west, brought porcelain, tea, silk, craftsmen, and did not bring the governor, did not bring the ambition to expand and dominate. </p>
					<p> Han and Tang Dynasties flourishing, once spent rain, the boat sentiment of the ancient Silk Road, highlighting the ancient Chinese civilization "peace, open, inclusive," the history of blood. </p>
					<img src="nimg/1_4442485851.jpg" />
					<h3>There are several pieces of ancient silk</h3>
					<p> From the Eurasian continent's cultural exchange channel, the academy is now more recognized that the Silk Road has three major routes: the desert oasis of the Silk Road, the Silk Road on the Sea and the grassland Silk Road. </p>
					<p> Desert Oasis Silk Road, the traditional sense of the Silk Road, from the ancient Chinese capital Changan, Luoyang, the Central Asian countries, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria and other places, to the Mediterranean, to Rome as the end, A total length of 6440 km. This road is considered to link the ancient East and West continent of the ancient civilization of the intersection of the road, and silk is the most representative goods along the road. </p>
					<p> The Maritime Silk Road is a sea channel connecting ancient China with the rest of the world. It consists of the "East China Sea Route" and the "South China Sea route". East China Sea routes from China to the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese archipelago, South China Sea routes from China to Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean region. Maritime Silk Road formed in the Qin and Han Dynasties, the development of the Three Kingdoms, the Sui Dynasty, prosperity in the Tang and Song Dynasties, the decline in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, is known as the most ancient maritime routes. The main port of the Silk Road on the sea has changed, but only Quanzhou is the starting point of the Silk Road recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. </p>
					<p> Grassland Silk Road is from the Central Plains region north, the more the Great Wall to the outside, through the Mongolian plateau, South Russia grassland to Europe's land trunk line. Ancient Chinese northern minorities to West Asia, Europe, silk and more to take this road. Because of its sections in the northern alpine region, from the transport of goods in addition to silk, the fur accounted for large, it is also known as "fur road." </p>
					<p>In addition, in ancient China there is an important southwest Silk Road, formed in the Han Dynasty, starting from Luoyang, by Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, to Myanmar, India, is a deep in the mountains and forests of trade culture thoroughfare, It is the first link between the two ancient civilizations in China and India, and strengthened the connection between the Silk Road on the land and the Silk Road on the sea and played an important role in the Han and Tang dynasties. </p>
					<h3> What are the provinces of China </h3>

					<img src="nimg/1_4442556353.jpg" />
					<p> Sui Dynasty Kaihuang years (AD 581-600 years), the Ministry of Personnel Bureau of Pei moment in the Hexi Corridor to carry out investment activities, is the prelude to the prosperity of the Silk Road.
